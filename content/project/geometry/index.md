Computational Geometry Course, March 2021, M.Sc. in Computer Science @UniMi

## About the project
{{< figure src="img.png" caption="Icosahedron obtained with the application." numbered="true" >}}

The aims of this project was to study how the tessellation works with simple domains and to
implement the basic logic for triangulate the vertices of simple
objects like cubes and then with more complex like torus, sphere and cylinder.

For the course project there was also a need to produce a report in the form of <a
    href="http://www.mat.unimi.it/users/alzati/Geometria_Computazionale_98-99/apps/trietas/index.html">website</a>
(fully in <i>italian</i>) which is hosted from the university's mathematics department <i>Federigo Enriques</i>. It contains
the theory behind the software, the technique involved, user manual of the application and lot of example videos about the application.

Is possible to download the source code of the project from the <a
    href="https://github.com/manuelpagliuca/Computational_Geometry_2021">GitHub Repository</a> by
following this link. The course was a complete math course and the project was developed using the
**OpenGL** specification.

By accessing the <a
    href="http://www.mat.unimi.it/users/alzati/Geometria_Computazionale_98-99/corso/autori.html">authors
    section</a> of the course website, is possible to read under my
name a note from the course teacher saying: <br><br>

*"has developed the project related to the triangulation and tessellation of the lateral
    surface of some geometric solids obtaining truly amazing visual effects."* - Prof. Alzati
