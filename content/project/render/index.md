Real-Time Graphics Programming Course, July 2021, M.Sc. in Computer Science @UniMi

## About the project
This was a project I made for the course of Real-time Graphics Programming. The course provided extensive knowledge about real-time computer graphics (you can check the {{< staticref "uploads/Appunti_RTGP.pdf" "newtab" >}}notes{{< /staticref >}} I took). At the end of the course, in addition to an oral exam, there was a project related to graphic programming to be developed with OpenGL. I asked Prof. Gadia if there was the possibility of developing it with Vulkan, he granted me the possibility to take this extra-step, it was very tiring but fruitful from the point of view of learning.

The project consists in a deferred renderer to improve the overall efficiency of the application in the usage of lights. The scene is composed of three models of the same character, a floor and twenty lights (whose movement and color can be modified), there is the {{< staticref "uploads/DEFERRED_RENDERING___RTGP.pdf" "newtab" >}}notes{{< /staticref >}} containing the various metrics obtained using a different number of lights. The GitHub repository is accessible at {{< staticref "https://github.com/manuelpagliuca/Vulkan-Deferred-Renderer" "newtab" >}}this{{< /staticref >}} link.
