## About the project

This is a project for the course of A.I. for VideoGames at University of Milan, A.Y. 2021/2022. The aim of the project is to implement a Lindenmayer system for procedural generation of tree using discrete distributions (pseudo-random integers) for enhancing the believability of the project.
