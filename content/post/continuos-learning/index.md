<center> ðŸš¨ <b>The whole blog post is a work in progress!</b> ðŸš¨</center>

> When you see ðŸš¨, this is a suggestion for the creator of the post (me), to update this blog post since I'm not following any structure, I'm just writing as it came out and adjusting by re-reading and rewriting the post ðŸ˜Š

Since when I was a kid I wanted to know as much as I could, I received my first computer when i was 8 years old, and since then I got hooked from internet, video games and programming.

I stop talking about this side of my self (I will do it in another post), the thing that I wanted to introduce is that I would like to have a way for quantify, store, and expand my knowledge.

ðŸš¨ Question to answer for the post:
* Why I created this post?
* How can this be helpful to me and to others?
* Education system vs learning system
* The problem with school
* ...

## How I take notes

ðŸš¨ Major structure ðŸš¨
* Obsidian
* Anki
* Techniques...
* Clear understanding of what he is saying
* Practical subject, I need to do practical exercise.

### Khan Academy
I love Khan's courses, and I hope to be able to complete the ones I like the most, there are a lot of them and I am particularly keen on taking good notes (transcripts in the case of humanities). If you don't know who is Salman Khan (called Sal), there is a really nice 20 minutes [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTFEUsudhfs) about his mission.

At the moment I'm following only the World History course, and I stopped the other ones, since I recently changed my note taking system and consequently I have to migrate many courses data to the new one. But I'm loving it and that's the important thing, since I was really disgusted by history during high school.
